Simple HTML5 Game

Javascript Delta
A couple of weeks ago I started a prototype for a horizontal shoot-em-up game in the style of the old c64 classic Delta. It was just a simple weekend project (although it ended up taking 2 - naturally) to allow the player to shoot some swirly alien bad guys…

… but it is in a good enough state to publish the source and let you play now:
arrow keys to fly
space to shoot.
shoot aliens
survive!

It's game from original resources https://codeincomplete.com/articles/javascript-delta/
